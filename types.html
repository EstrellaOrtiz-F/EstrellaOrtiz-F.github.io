      <h2>5 Major Types of Programming Languages</h2>
      <p>Programming languages can be grouped into five main categories, though some languages fit into more than one:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Procedural Programming Languages</strong><br>
          These languages follow a sequence of instructions or procedures to
          perform tasks. Programs are structured as sets of procedures.
          Examples include: C, C++, Java, Pascal, BASIC.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Functional Programming Languages</strong><br>
          Functional languages emphasize mathematical functions and their
          evaluations. Each function is a reusable block of code that returns
          a result based on input data. Popular examples are: Scala, Erlang,
          Haskell, Elixir, F#.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Object-Oriented Programming Languages</strong><br>
          These treat programs as collections of "objects" containing data
          (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Objects can be reused, making
          it ideal for complex, scalable software. Common languages include:
          Java, Python, PHP, C++, Ruby.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scripting Languages</strong><br>
          Used to automate repetitive tasks, manage web content, or support
          larger applications. Widely-used scripting languages are: PHP,
          Ruby, Python, Bash, Perl, Node.js.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Logic Programming Languages</strong><br>
          Instead of specifying steps, logic languages define facts and rules
          to guide decision-making. Examples include: Prolog, Absys, Datalog,
          Alma-0.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Other Ways to Classify Programming Languages</h3>

      <h4>Front-end vs. Back-end Languages</h4>
      <p><strong>Front-end</strong> languages handle everything the user interacts with visually, such as text, colors, and buttons. Examples include: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.</p>
      <p><strong>Back-end</strong> languages manage server-side tasks like data storage and application logic. Examples include: JavaScript, PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, C#.</p>

      <h4>High-level vs. Low-level Languages</h4>
      <p><strong>Low-level</strong> languages communicate closely with the machineâ€™s hardware, offering efficiency but harder readability. These include machine code and assembly languages.</p>
      <p><strong>High-level</strong> languages prioritize human readability and ease of use, trading some efficiency. Most modern languages fall into this category.</p>

      <h4>Interpreted vs. Compiled Languages</h4>
      <p><strong>Interpreted</strong> languages run code line-by-line via an interpreter, offering flexibility and platform independence. Examples include: Python, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby.</p>
      <p><strong>Compiled</strong> languages convert the whole program into machine code beforehand, resulting in faster execution but requiring recompilation after changes. Examples include: C, C++, C#, Rust, Erlang.</p>
